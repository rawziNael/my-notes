To be a good programmer, there are some key points that every developer must master:
1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software
2. The Goals of Software Design

    > Design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be and continue to be as helpful as possible. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity
    > 
3. (Mis)understanding  
      Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.
4. Complexity  
      Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
5. Solving Problems  
   - Understanding  
   - Planning  
   - Dividing

6. Predictions     
    Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
7. Assumptions
    > An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.
    >
8. Testing  
    When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn’t guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption. Most probably, you will be wrong. You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix.
